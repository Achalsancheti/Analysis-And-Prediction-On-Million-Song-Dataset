# Analysis and Prediction on Million Song Dataset
This is a repository for Million song Dataset project as part of INFO 7250 course at NEU.

The Million Songs Dataset is a collection of 28 datasets containing audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. 

Developed the prediction model with Azure Machine learning for the possible number of audience and the possible number of views for the upcoming song using Bayesian Linear Regression Model.

Designed and developed the graph database, displaying the relationship between users and songs using Neo4j. Also developed the web demo to get the details of a particular song, that is connected with Neo4j graph database.

Designed a multi-node, fully-distributed Hadoop file system on AWS Elastic Map Reduce (also with EC2 and S3 for storage).

Used Apache PIG and MapReduce to process and generate the dataset with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

Used Plotly to represent graphs and Google API to represent the location of a particular artist mentioned in the dataset.

You can find the Taste profile subset dataset that has user listening data with MSD songs at : http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile
